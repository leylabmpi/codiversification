# Summary

The notebooks in this directory provide code on:

* Inferring genome phylogenies for each target species
* Getting genomic traits for publicly available genomes for each target species
  * Summarizing the trait data
  * Machine learning to predict cophylogeny based on trait features

# Notation

* `HUBIF-TUK-CAM-KOR` = the merged dataset
* `HUBIF` = Gabon, Vietnam, & Tuebingen, Germany
* `TUK` = TwinsUK cohort
* `KOR` = Korean dataset
